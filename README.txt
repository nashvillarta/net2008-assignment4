1.  Application Description:
You can run this application through your terminal. On my machine, I installed python for windows which allowed me to run it as a python terminal application.

It is a average grade calculator for 5 courses. Once you have inputted grades for 5 courses, it displays the average between all courses. It accounts for value errors and if it is less than 0, it sets it as 0 to stop negative numbers.

Sidenote: I did not look into the application based tutorials using gui as I initially thought just to code one myself.Followed tutorial for creating docker hub image creation.
